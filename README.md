# About Me
I've been engaged in software development since the mid-1980s. For the first 13 years of my career, I worked as a professional software engineer, with a primary focus on Java. In 2011, my career shifted towards technology leadership, where I discovered a passion for leading high-performing software development teams using lean methodologies.

I've always maintained my enthusiasm for software engineering, and since 2011, I've continued to explore software and technology in my spare time. Lately, I've shifted from manually writing code to increasingly using existing technologies to address challenges.
