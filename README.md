# About Me
I've been engaged in software development since the mid-1980s. For the first 13 years of my career, I worked as a professional software engineer, with a primary focus on Java. In 2011, my career shifted towards technology leadership, where I discovered a passion for leading high-performing software development teams using lean methodologies.

I've always maintained my enthusiasm for software engineering, and since 2011, I've continued to explore software and technology in my spare time. Lately, I've shifted from manually writing code to increasingly using existing technologies to address challenges.

Catchup with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steventheisen/), drop me a note in the [Home Assistant Community](https://community.home-assistant.io/), or chat with me on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/1068267562988740689). I look forward to hearing from you.

# Solution Engineering
I'm passionate about Docker Solution Engineering, where I take pre-built Docker containers and fine-tune them to solve specific problems efficiently. My projects showcase customized Docker stacks, optimized for unique use cases with streamlined configuration and deployment.

- [docker-plex-nvidia](https://github.com/tyzen9/docker-plex-nvidia) - A Docker container for Plex that leverages an Nvidia GPU for transcoding
- [docker-piwigo](https://github.com/tyzen9/docker-piwigo) - A Docker container for setting up a Piwigo open source photo management website.

# Home Assistant
Home Assistant is free and open-source software for home automation designed to be a central control system for smart home devices with a focus on local control and privacy. It is one of my most time consuming passions and hobby, and experience I am happy to share with the community.

# Servarr Seedbox
Servarr is an ecosystem of open-source applications designed for automating and managing personal media libraries. 
I find this ecosystem fascinating, and have enjoyed experimenting with this technology.
